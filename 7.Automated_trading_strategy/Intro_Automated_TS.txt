in an automated fashion.

Direct access to stock exchange:
      - Mandatory for High freq. trading system (expensive)
      - Colocation - put your server in stock exchange's network (most likely in the same permises as their own servers)
      - Gain milliseconds in trade execution downtime over competitors.
API Trading:
      - Let's you connect with broker to obtain real time pricing and account information and place trade orders.
      - RESTful APIs
      - Performance is similar to trading using broker's interface
      - Fairly cheap to put together an automated traiding system using API trading
      - Many brokers provide free demo API trading accounts or other promotions
      - Always test the performance of the API interface before buying subscription
      - FXCM demo account (will discuss)
