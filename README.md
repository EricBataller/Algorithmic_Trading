A set of tools to build an automated trading machine

In this repository you'll find a set of tools that will allow you to perform an automated trading strategy by making use of any broker's RESTful API. Each folder contains py files with a brief explanation of the concepts we work with and their implementations. Finally, the last two folders contain examples of implementations on how to build an automated investing strategy, and most importantly, how to backtest the data to analyse their effectiveness and calculate some performance measurements.
