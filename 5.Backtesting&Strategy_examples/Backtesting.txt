
------- BACKTESTING --------

1. Test strategy by applying the rules and trading signal criteria on historical
data mimicking actual trading conditions.

2. Factor in slippage, trading/brokerage cost when assessing the performance.

3. Be conservative -err on the side of caution. For example, consider the slippage that
you'd get in your worst day when you place a market order.

4. Backtesting is of critical importance in assessing the merit of a trading strategy/system.

5. Don't deploy strategy in live market until back tested.

6. Criticism - Since it is based on historical data it has little predictive power.
